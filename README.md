This repository contains code to produce figures in the Final Technical
Report for the project, “Understanding the Risk of Bat-Borne Zoonotic
Disease Emergence in Western Asia” (HDTRA1-17-1-0064). This project
identified key factors correlated with the risk of bat viral zoonoses
from sites across Western Asia. The data needed to reproduce the
analyses are in the process of being uploaded to separate repositories.
